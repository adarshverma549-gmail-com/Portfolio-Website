# Getting Started with Create React App

### `In the project directory, you can deploy the GitHub Page:`

1.  firstly create React App.

```
2. create react components
```bash 
npm start 
    or
npm run dev 
```

3. Build the React App.
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Open your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field for your project:
```
  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
```

5. Add the following `scripts` in your `package.json`:
```bash
"scripts": 
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build", 
#    you'll need to make one additional modification:
-   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -b master -d build",
```
6. Deploy the site by running
